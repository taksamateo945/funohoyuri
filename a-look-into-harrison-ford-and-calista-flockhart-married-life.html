The pair initially met at the 2002 Golden Globe Awards, when Ford received the Cecil B. DeMille Award.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Flockhart received an Emmy nomination for her performance as Ally McBeal. Despite their 22-year age difference, the two hit it off instantly after the meeting. Only a year later, in an interview with Hello, Ford openly confessed his love for the actress.</p><p>“Romantic love is one of the most exciting and satisfying types of love, and I believe it is possible at any time of your life.” So I wasn’t shocked when I fell in love.”</p><p>At the time, Ford was going through a divorce with screenwriter Melissa Mathison, with whom he had two daughters. As a result, the couple kept their relationship quiet at first, finally marrying in 2010.</p><h2>Harrison Ford’s Long-Term Married Life</h2><p>Ford and Flockhart are still married and have been for almost two decades. Their marriage has certainly lasted the test of time, and when questioned about the keys to a long-lasting and good marriage, Ford had something to say.&nbsp;During an interview with Parade just before his 10th anniversary, the Indiana Jones actor opened up about some marital tactics he learned over the years.&nbsp;His finest marital advice was to “nod your head” rather than “speak.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Harrison-Ford-2.jpg alt="Harrison Ford" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“Is there another secret?” Finish your duties!” With his caustic wit, the actor quipped that these duties were supplied to him by his wife, saying that they were “honey do’s.”</p><p>Perhaps it’s their common sense of humor that has kept them together for the last two decades.&nbsp;When asked how she and her husband kept the flame alive in their marriage in 2017, Flockhart told Closer Weekly that she and Ford laughed a lot and that comedy was vital to her.&nbsp;She went on to say that their age difference had never been a problem in their relationship. Despite the fact that Ford was considerably older than her, she sometimes felt much older than him and forgot how much older he was.</p><h2>Harrison Ford’s Previous Divorces</h2><p>Ford had been married and divorced twice before finding his happily ever after with his wife. After meeting at a liberal arts institution in Wisconsin, the actor and his first wife, Mary Marquardt, married on June 18, 1964.&nbsp;On September 22, 1966, they received their first son, Benjamin, and three years later, Willard. In 1979, the couple announced it quits.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Harrison-Ford-3.jpg alt="Harrison Ford" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After Marquardt, Ford moved on to Melissa Mathison, who is best known for penning the scripts for 1982’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The former couple met on the set of Apocalypse Now.&nbsp;The couple married in 1983, and four years later, they received a boy called Malcolm and three years later, a daughter named Georgia.&nbsp;The couple finally called it quits, and their divorce was formalized in 2004. According to accounts, they were on excellent terms until Mathison died of cancer in 2015.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmagkae%2Fqr%2FOp2Sfp6KZeqK6w2aamqSZqMGiecWlppyjmJa%2FtXnMmqmroZWZeq21xZ5m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wendy-williams-links-up-with-blac-chyna-and-calls-her-little-sister-after-hanging-out-with-the-kardashians-290674.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wendy Williams Links Up With Blac Chyna And Calls Her Little Sister, After Hanging Out With Th">&larr;
