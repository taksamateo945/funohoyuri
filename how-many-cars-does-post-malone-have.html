His </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>collection</strong></a><strong> includes a Rolls Royce, Bugatti, and Chevrolet.</strong></p><p>Read more below about Post Malone and his impressive collection of cars.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Car Collection</h2><p>Post Malone’s taste in cars is diverse, featuring everything from pristine, high-end sports cars to battered trucks.&nbsp;</p><p>One of his larger vehicles is a Chevrolet C-10, which is emblazoned with badges. The rapper has had the car customized to give it his own stamp, with custom two-tone paint and lowered suspension.</p><p>Also in his collection is a Rolls Royce Phantom, his second vehicle from the prestigious manufacturer. The model is thought to be worth around $420,000.</p><p>Before buying the Phantom, he owned a <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolls Royce Wraith</a>, a cheaper model, though with a price tag of around $320,000, still an extremely high-end ride. The first Rolls Royce was involved in an accident when a Kia collided with it.</p><p>“I f*cking totaled my other one so we went and got…the bigger one, the funner one,” he said. It’s unclear whether he was the driver at the time but it’s thought that nobody was seriously injured.</p><p>Perhaps his most expensive car yet is his Bugatti Chiron. The all-white Bugatti is thought to have cost around $3 million and has a crisp white leather interior with sporty, cross stitch seats.</p><p>The car has a top speed of more than 260mph.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Also in 2019, he added a <a href=# rel=noopener>Subaru WRX</a> to his collection, choosing a white paint finish and an auto rather than a manual transmission. This is one of his more relaxed and less attention-grabbing rides, though fans have still managed to spot him while driving around Salt Lake City.</p><p>The artist bought the car from a local dealer, and they thanked him online for “Being so kind and generous.”</p><p>“Post Malone took the time to meet our employees, take pictures, and give autographs! Post, you have fans for life at Nate Wade Subaru,” the dealer posted on their Facebook page.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-facebook wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-facebook"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Post Malone?</h2><p>From his impressive car collection, it’s clear that Post Malone is successful. Full name <a href=# rel=noopener>Austin Richard Post</a>, he was born in New York in 1995.</p><p>His parents divorced and he spent much of his childhood with his father. At the age of nine, he relocated to Texas with his father and stepmother.</p><p>By playing the game Guitar Hero, he became inspired to follow a career in music and auditioned for his first band, though he was ultimately not accepted. As a teen, he began creating mixtapes and shared them with peers.</p><p>After high school, he enrolled in Tarrant County College and worked in a fast-food restaurant for cash. He soon left college to move to LA with a friend, where he worked with other artists to create the band BLCKVRD.</p><p>He released the track ‘White Iverson’ in 2015, and the music video racked up over one million views. Within weeks, he was offered a record deal.</p><p>In the same month, Post Malone performed at the 18th birthday party of reality TV star Kylie Jenner and met her brother in law Kanye West at the event. West invited him to collaborate, and collaborations with other high profile rappers soon followed.</p><p>During Justin Bieber’s 2016 world tour, Post Malone was the opening act and was gaining an increasingly large following. His first full mixtape was released in the same year, with ‘Stoney’, his debut album, following in December.</p><p>‘Beerbongs & Bentleys’, his second album, came in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>The artist has had 47 songs appear in the <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard Hot 100</a> chart, with nine of these reaching the top ten. Four of his tracks, ‘Sunflower’, ‘Circles’, ‘Rockstar’ and ‘Psycho’ reached the number one spot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWdlru6ecKaqaxllKSytHnPqKqtZZ2WubC6xGafmq6VZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./demi-moore-looks-just-like-tallulah-and-rumer-willis-on-night-out-20142410.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Demi Moore Looks Just Like Tallulah and Rumer Willis On Night Out">&larr;
