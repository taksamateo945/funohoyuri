He is a multiple-time winner of the Atlantic Coast Conference Men’s Basketball Coach of the Year award as well as the <a href=#>Henry Iba</a> Award as the NCAA’s top men’s basketball coach. In 2019, he led Virginia to an NCAA Championship.</p><p>He coached future NBA forward <a href=#>Mike Scott</a> at the University of Virginia.</p><p>UVA brought in a well-rounded recruiting class which included Bennett’s first McDonald’s All-American, a consensus top 50 recruit, Kyle Guy. Former five-star recruit and transfer Austin Nichols became eligible after sitting out the previous season, but was suspended for two weeks including the season opening game for an undisclosed incident and dismissed entirely for a second undisclosed incident after playing (and starting) in one game. UVA nonetheless broke its record for consecutive weeks ranked in the AP Top 25 poll with a streak of 64 polling weeks spanning more than three years, breaking its previous best of 49 in the 1980s. Bennett recorded his 250th win as a head coach against No. 14 Notre Dame, in South Bend, 71–54, while extending his record against Mike Brey to 5–0. The Cavaliers notched impressive double-digit victories over eventual national champions No. 5 North Carolina, 53–43, and No. 4 ranked Louisville, 71–55. This completed Bennett’s head-to-head rivalry record against Hall of Famer Rick Pitino at 5–1 before Pitino was dismissed for NCAA rules violations in the off-season.</p><p>As a 5’11” guard, Bennett ranks first in NCAA history for career three-point field goal accuracy at 49.7%, shooting above 50% from range in both his junior and senior seasons. He started for the United States national team at the 1991 Pan American Games, was awarded the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award as the nation’s top player under six feet tall, and was named Academic All-American of the Year as the nation’s top basketball student-athlete.
