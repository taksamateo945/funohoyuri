The band was also nominated for a Billboard Latin Music Award for Artist of the Year in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Erick-Brian-Colón.jpg><h2><span id=Education_and_early_life>Education and early life</span></h2><p>Erick and his sister Yanelis Colon were raised in Cuba by their father and mother about whom Erick avoids speaking in public as he respects their privacy; it’s known that he moved to Tampa, Florida together with his sister and mother when he was 11, but it’s widely believed that his parents divorced a couple of months before this.</p><p>Erick grew up being passionate about singing, and was eight when he began taking singing lessons. He went on to attend a local high school in Tampa, and was into various activities during his four years there, as he was a member of the school’s drama club, played basketball and ran track; Erick appeared in various school plays, often singing and dancing as the lead character, and he also considered pursuing a career in the film industry.</p><p>Upon <a rel=nofollow href=#>matriculating in 2019</a>, he chose not to go after a college degree, but to remain focused on music.</p><h2><span id=About_his_band_CNCO>About his band CNCO</span></h2><p>All the five boys auditioned during the first season of the singing competition show “La Banda”, which famous British TV personality and record executive Simon Cowell created, and popular Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Ricky Martin produced. The boys passed through several stages as they went on to win the show; their band was officially founded on the show’s finale on 13 December 2015, and they were given the name CNCO, with ‘cinco’ meaning ‘five’ in Spanish.</p><p>The band signed a five-year contract with Sony Music Latin, Ricky Martin became their representative, and their debut album was to be produced by popular Puerto Rican rapper Wisin.</p><p lang=es dir=ltr>Hola Hola ✌️😘 Mi Gente Linda !
